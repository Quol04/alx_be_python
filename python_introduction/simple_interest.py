# Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

principal = 1000  # Representing $1000
rate = 0.05       # Representing 5% annual interest rate
time = 3          # Representing 3 years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Display the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
